ICE Network is an EVM compatible network built with Parityâ€™s Substrate framework. ICE is the first network to use the Substrate SDK to extend the feature-set of an existing layer one blockchain protocol. In addition, ICE will provide the much-needed addition of EVM compatibility to the ICON ecosystem

## Build & Run

To build the chain, execute the following commands from the project root:

```
$ cargo build --release
```

To execute the chain, run:

```
$ ./target/release/ice-node --dev
```

The node also supports to use manual seal (to produce block manually through RPC).  
This is also used by the ts-tests:

```
$ ./target/release/ice-node --dev --manual-seal
```
